"use strict" // treat all code in js acoording to newer version

// Data Types -->
// 2 types --> 1. Primitive   2. Non-Primitive
// 1. Primitive --> there are 7 premitive data type : 1.Number 2.BigInt 3.String 4.Boolean 5.Null 6.Undefined 7.Symbol
// 2. Non-Primitive --> 1.Object

// Null --> The result of typeof null is "object". Thatâ€™s an officially recognized error in typeof, coming from very early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, null is not an object. It is a special value with a separate type of its own. The behavior of typeof is wrong here.

// Symbol --> for uniqueness
